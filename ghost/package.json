  "readme": "# [Ghost](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TryGhost/Ghost.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TryGhost/Ghost)\n\nGhost is a free, open, simple blogging platform that's available to anyone who wants to use it. Lovingly created and maintained by [John O'Nolan](http://twitter.com/JohnONolan) + [Hannah Wolfe](http://twitter.com/ErisDS) + an amazing group of [contributors](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/contributors).\n\nVisit the project's website at <http://ghost.org> &bull; docs on <http://docs.ghost.org>.\n\n## Getting Involved\n\nWant to report a bug, request a feature, or help us build or translate Ghost? Check out our in depth guide to [Contributing to Ghost](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). We need all the help we can get! You can also join in with our [community](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost#community) to keep up-to-date and meet other Ghosters.\n\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThere are **two** main ways to get started with Ghost, take care to use the method which best suits your needs.\n\n**Please note** - the downloadable zip files we provide on [Ghost.org](http://ghost.org/download) are pre-built packages designed for getting started quickly. Cloning from the git repository requires you to install several dependencies and build the assets yourself. \n\n### Getting Started Guide for Bloggers\n\nIf you just want to get a Ghost blog running in the fastest time possible, this method is for you.\n\nFor detailed instructions for various platforms visit the [Ghost Installation Guide](http://docs.ghost.org/installation/). If you get stuck, help is available on [our forum](http://ghost.org/forum/).\n\n1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) - Ghost requires **Node v0.10.**\n1. Download the latest Ghost package from [Ghost.org](http://ghost.org/download). \n   **If you cloned the GitHub repository you should follow the instructions [for developers](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost#getting-started-guide-for-developers).**\n1. Create a new directory where you would like to run the code, and unzip the package to that location.\n1. Fire up a terminal (or node command prompt in Windows) and change directory to the root of the Ghost application (where config.example.js and index.js are)\n1. run `npm install --production` to install the node dependencies. If you see `error Error: ENOENT` on this step, make sure you are in the project directory and try again.\n1. To start ghost, run `npm start`\n1. Visit `http://localhost:2368/` in your web browser or go to `http://localhost:2368/ghost` to log in\n\nCheck out the [Documentation](http://docs.ghost.org/) for more detailed instructions, or get in touch via the [forum](http://ghost.org/forum) if you get stuck.\n\n\n\n### Getting Started Guide for Developers\n\nIf you're a theme, app or core developer, or someone comfortable getting up and running from a `git clone`, this method is for you.\n\nIf you clone the GitHub repository, you will need to build a number of assets using grunt. \n\n#### Quickstart:\n\n1. `npm install -g grunt-cli`\n1. `npm install`\n1. `grunt init` (and `grunt prod` if you want to run Ghost in production mode)\n1. `npm start`\n\nFull instructions & troubleshooting tips can be found in the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) under the heading \"[Working on Ghost Core](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#working-on-ghost-core)\".\n\nCheck out the [Documentation](http://docs.ghost.org/) for more detailed instructions, or get in touch via the [forum](http://ghost.org/forum) if you get stuck.\n\nIf you want to use [Ghost as a NPM module there is a Wiki entry](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/wiki/Using-Ghost-as-a-NPM-module) where you can find instructions on how to get set up.\n\n### Upgrading to The Latest Version\n\nUpgrade instructions are in the [Ghost Guide](http://docs.ghost.org/installation/upgrading/)\n\n### Logging in For The First Time\n\nOnce you have the Ghost server up and running, you should be able to navigate to `http://localhost:2368/ghost/` from a web browser, where you will be prompted to register a new user. Once you have entered your desired credentials you will be automatically logged in to the admin area.\n\n\n## Community\n\nKeep track of Ghost development and Ghost community activity.\n\n* Follow Ghost on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/TryGhost), [Facebook](http://facebook.com/tryghostapp) and [Google+](https://plus.google.com/114465948129362706086).\n* Read and subscribe to the [The Official Ghost Blog](http://blog.ghost.org).\n* Join in discussions on the [Ghost Forum](http://ghost.org/forum/)\n* Chat with Ghost developers on IRC. We're on `irc.freenode.net`, in the `#Ghost` channel. We have a public meeting every Tuesday at 5:30pm London time.\n\n\n## Versioning\n\nFor transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, Ghost will be maintained according to the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) guidelines as much as possible.\n\nReleases will be numbered with the following format:\n\n`<major>.<minor>.<patch>-<build>`\n\nConstructed with the following guidelines:\n\n* A new *major* release indicates a large change where backwards compatibility is broken.\n* A new *minor* release indicates a normal change that maintains backwards compatibility.\n* A new *patch* release indicates a bugfix or small change which does not affect compatibility.\n* A new *build* release indicates this is a pre-release of the version.\n\n\n## Copyright & License\n\nCopyright (c) 2013-2014 Ghost Foundation - Released under the [MIT license](LICENSE).\n",
